////////////////////////////////////// HOW TO ADD/ REMOVE FROM AN ARRAY
// Using PUSH()-- to add an element to the end of the array-- and POP() --to delete the last element of an array-- have not a great performance in a great scale, itÂ´s better to use the object Spread method, simplier and faster.
// Also you may use the method array.concat(array2) to join two arrays. But those are imperative methods, and to very convenient or flexible to work with...

const fruits= ["melon", "grapes", "watermelon"]
const vegetables=["pumpkin", "onion", "carrot"]
vegetables.push("parsley")
fruits.pop("melon")
const mix= vegetables.concat(fruits)

 console.log(mix) 

 // On these cases, it's better to use an object spread, that joins so many arrays as we want, and we can add more elements at any point of the array

 const mixture =[ // Use [], we are working with arrays, not objects, YOU FOOL!
    ...fruits,
    "pear",
    ...vegetables,
    "parsley",
]

console.log(mixture)
